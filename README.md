# Rift Derandomizer

I personally find grinding gear with randomly generated stats to be strage when crafting with *Space Magick TM*, unnecessary for a single player experience and especially slow, and tedious with the clicking required in the crafting and inventory interface.

So to eliminate it from my gameplay by resurrecting the *No Random Stats* mod which is unmaintained. 
With input from the Riftbreaker community I decided to also incorporate the behavior of the *Crit and Stun Weapon Mod Simplifier* mod.

This repository is home to the mod itself plus the python scripts which generate it.

Weapon Stats and Weapons Mods have been done. Entity Mods are ~~coming soon~~ **done!**.
