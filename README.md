# Rift Derandomizer

Do you find grinding gear with randomly generated stats to be...

- Unnecessary for a single player experience and especially slow?
- Tedious with the clicking required in the crafting and inventory interface?
- Just strage when crafting with *Space Magick TM* that should have better quality control?

If so then eliminate it from your gameplay entirely with this resurrection of the *No Random Stats* mod!

With input from the Riftbreaker community it was decided to also incorporate the behavior of the *Crit and Stun Weapon Mod Simplifier* mod. 
This avoids potential a conflict between the two mods. You need should only install one or the other.

This repository is home to the mod itself plus the python scripts which generate it.

Weapon Stats and Weapons Mods have been done. Entity Mods are ~~coming soon~~ **done!**
