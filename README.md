# Rift Derandomizer

Based on the *No Random Stats* mod which is unmaintained with input from the community to incorporate the behavior of the *Crit and Stun Weapon Mod Simplifier* mod.

This repository is home to the mod itself and the python scripts which generate it.

Weapon Stats and Weapons Mods have been done. Entity Mods are coming soon.

## Manual Installation

1. Download the .zip
2. Drop into game's mods subfolder

## Fancy Installation

Release on mod.io coming... eventually?
It seems things cannot be simply uploaded there.
